# Java Calculator (Android and GUI)

**A calculator application implemented in Java, with both an Android version and a separate GUI version for desktop use.**

## Description

This project contains the source code for a calculator application implemented in Java. It includes two versions:

*   **Android Calculator:** This is the `MainActivity.java` and associated XML layout files for an Android calculator application. The complete Android project was developed in Android Studio.
*   **GUI Calculator (CalculatorGUI.java):** This is a standalone GUI-based calculator that can be run in any Java environment.

The Android version is designed to run on Android devices, while the GUI version provides a desktop calculator experience.

## Key Files

*   `MainActivity.java`: The main activity class for the Android calculator application. Contains the logic for handling button presses and performing calculations.
*   `activity_main.xml`: The XML layout file for the Android calculator's user interface.
*   `CalculatorGUI.java`: A standalone Java file that implements a GUI-based calculator using Swing.

## Notes

*   The Android version requires Android Studio to build and run.
*   The `CalculatorGUI.java` version can be compiled and run in any Java environment that supports Swing.

## Potential Improvements

*   **Advanced Functions:** Implement more advanced mathematical functions (e.g., trigonometric functions, logarithms).
*   **Error Handling:** Improve error handling to gracefully handle invalid inputs.
*   **Memory Functions:** Add memory functions (M+, M-, MR, MC).
*   **Theming:** Allow users to customize the appearance of the calculator.
